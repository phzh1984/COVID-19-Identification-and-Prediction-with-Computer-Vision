# COVID-19-Identification-and-Prediction-with-Computer-Vision

Introduction

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious illness caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It has since been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Computer Vision has emerged as a powerful tool in the fight against COVID-19, allowing for the automated analysis of medical images such as CT scans. This repository provides access to a large dataset of CT scans, collected from real patients in hospitals in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and encourages the development of artificial intelligence methods for the identification and prediction of COVID-19 using Computer Vision techniques.

Dataset Overview

Total CT Scans: 2,482 scans
COVID-19 Positive CT Scans: 1,252 scans
Non-COVID CT Scans: 1,230 scans

Primary goal

The primary goal of this dataset is to foster research and development in the field of Computer Vision for COVID-19 identification and prediction using lung CT scans. Researchers and developers can leverage this dataset to create intelligent models capable of automatically detecting and predicting COVID-19 based on CT image analysis.

About CT scans

CT scans are a vital tool for assessing the severity of COVID-19 infection, especially in patients with serious symptoms. They provide valuable insights into lung blockages, enabling healthcare professionals to tailor treatment plans accordingly.
